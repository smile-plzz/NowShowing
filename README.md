# NowShowing

NowShowing is a simple, responsive movie streaming website that allows users to search for movies, view their details, and stream them from various third-party sources.

## Features

*   **Movie Search:** Search for movies and TV shows using the OMDb API.
*   **Movie/TV Show Details:** View titles, overviews, and posters.
*   **Season & Episode Selection:** For TV shows, select specific seasons and episodes to watch.
*   **Multiple Streaming Sources:** Switch between different video sources (VidSrc.to (default), VidCloud, fsapi.xyz, CurtStream (movies only), VidSrc.xyz, VidSrc.in, SuperEmbed, MoviesAPI, 2Embed, Fmovies, LookMovie) for improved reliability, with robust handling for both movies and TV show episodes. If no sources are available, a detailed notification will guide the user to troubleshoot and try other options.
*   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, with improved navbar layout on smaller screens.
*   **Modern UI/UX:** Clean design with subtle animations, skeleton loading for a smooth user experience, and a dynamic hero section.
*   **Movie/TV Show Navigation:** Easily switch between popular movies and TV shows using dedicated navigation links. (Note: Popular movie and TV show lists are currently hardcoded due to OMDb API limitations. For dynamic popular content, consider integrating an API like TMDb.)
*   **News Widget:** Stay updated with the latest movie and TV show news from GNews API, with a "Load More" option to fetch more articles (note: GNews free tier has limitations on pagination).
*   **Video Modal:** Seamless video playback within a modal window with availability indicators, autoplay enabled, and comprehensive details including ratings (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic), MPAA/TV rating, runtime, language, country, box office, production, and website. Improved performance and responsiveness for extended use by optimizing event listener management.
*   **Accessibility Enhancements:** Improved keyboard navigation, focus management for modals, and added ARIA attributes for better screen reader compatibility.
*   **Developer Message:** A dedicated button and modal to share a message from the developer, including contact information and GitHub profile.
*   **Watchlist:** Save titles for later viewing; add/remove via modal toggle; persists in localStorage.
*   **Continue Watching:** Quickly resume recently played movies and episodes; automatically updated when you switch sources.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the website structure.
*   **CSS3:** For styling and responsive design.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For dynamic content, API interactions, and UI logic.
*   **Node.js (Vercel Serverless Functions):** For backend video availability checks (`check-video.js`, `fetch-news.js`, `omdb-proxy.js`).
*   **OMDb API:** Used to fetch movie and TV show data (titles, plots, posters, IMDb IDs, season/episode details).
*   **Third-Party Video Embeds:** Integrates with various video embedding services (e.g., VidSrc, SuperEmbed, 2Embed, Fmovies, LookMovie) to stream content.



## Setup and Installation

This project includes a small backend component (a Vercel Serverless Function) to check video source availability. To get started:

1.  **Clone or Download:** Download the project files to your local machine.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project root in your terminal and run `npm install` to install both frontend and backend dependencies.
3.  **Testing:**
    *   This project uses Jest for testing. The configuration is in `jest.config.cjs` and Babel configuration in `babel.config.cjs`.
    *   Run tests using `npm test`.
4.  **Run Locally (for development with backend):**
    *   Install Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
    *   **Set OMDb API Key & GNews API Key:** Before running, set your OMDb API key and GNews API key as environment variables. The OMDb API key is now used by a serverless proxy function to protect it from client-side exposure. For local development, you can create a `.env` file in your project root with `OMDB_API_KEY=your_omdb_api_key_here` and `GNEWS_API_KEY=your_gnews_api_key_here`.
    *   From the project root, run `vercel dev` to start a local development server that includes the serverless function.
    *   Open the URL provided by Vercel CLI (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) in your browser.
4.  **Deploy to Vercel:**
    *   Ensure you have a Vercel account and the Vercel CLI installed and logged in (`vercel login`).
    *   **Set OMDb API Key & GNews API Key on Vercel:** Go to your Vercel project dashboard -> Settings -> Environment Variables. Add new variables named `OMDB_API_KEY` and `GNEWS_API_KEY` with your respective API keys as their values.
    *   From the project root, run `vercel deploy`.
    *   Follow the prompts to deploy your project. Vercel will automatically detect the serverless function in the `api` directory.

### Security & Performance

*   API keys are kept server-side via serverless functions (`/api/*`).
*   Content Security Policy and other security headers are set via `vercel.json`.
*   Service Worker and Web App Manifest are included for basic offline caching and installability.

## Usage

1.  **Search for a Movie:** Use the search bar in the navigation to find a movie. Type the movie title and press Enter or click the search button.
2.  **Browse Popular Movies:** The homepage displays a selection of popular movies.
3.  **Watch a Movie:** Click on a movie card to open the video player modal.
4.  **Switch Sources:** Inside the video player modal, you will see source buttons. Buttons will be colored green if the backend indicates the source is likely available, and red if it's unavailable. All buttons are clickable, allowing you to manually try any source.

## API Key

This project uses the OMDb API to fetch movie data and the GNews API for news. You must set the `OMDB_API_KEY` and `GNEWS_API_KEY` environment variables in your Vercel project settings for the application to function correctly.

## Disclaimer

This project relies on third-party video embedding services. The availability and content of streams are dependent on these external services, and their reliability can vary. While a backend check has been implemented to improve reliability, it is still an estimation. Users are advised to be aware of the terms of service and content policies of these third-party providers.

## Future Enhancements

*   **Genre/Category Filtering:** Add options to browse movies by genre or category.
*   **User Accounts:** Implement user authentication and personalized watchlists.
*   **Improved Search:** Add more advanced search filters (e.g., year, director).
*   **More Robust Backend Checks:** Enhance the backend to perform deeper content analysis (e.g., parsing HTML for "unavailable" messages).
*   **Backend Integration:** Develop a more comprehensive backend to manage movie data and user preferences more efficiently.
*   **Trending Data:** Integrate TMDb for real trending lists while retaining OMDb for details.
*   **Infinite Scroll & Filters:** Replace pagination with IntersectionObserver and add advanced filters (year, rating, type).

*   **API Documentation:** Detailed information on the serverless functions and their usage can be found in [API.md](api/API.md).
