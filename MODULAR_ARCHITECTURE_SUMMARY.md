## 🚀 **Benefits of New Architecture**

### **For Developers**
1. **Easier Navigation**: Find specific functionality quickly
2. **Focused Development**: Work on one concern at a time
3. **Better Testing**: Test individual modules in isolation
4. **Reduced Conflicts**: Less merge conflicts in team development
5. **Clearer Dependencies**: Explicit import/export relationships

### **For Maintenance**
1. **Bug Isolation**: Issues are contained within specific modules
2. **Feature Addition**: Add new features without affecting existing code
3. **Code Review**: Smaller, focused code reviews
4. **Documentation**: Each module has a clear purpose and API

### **For Performance**
1. **Lazy Loading**: Modules can be loaded on demand
2. **Tree Shaking**: Unused code can be eliminated
3. **Caching**: Individual modules can be cached separately
4. **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers can work on different modules
